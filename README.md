# Booking System

**Booking System** is a Laravel-based web application for managing **hotel and flight reservations**.  
It provides a simple and structured workflow for handling customers, passengers, bookings, and pricing details.  
The system has two roles: **Customer** (to make bookings) and **Admin** (to view stats and manage dashboard).

## üìñ Project Overview
- Customers can create bookings for hotels or flights.
- Customers provide their details and can add  passengers/guests (name, email, phone).
- Each booking stores a related **Hotel/Flight ID**.
- Pricing breakdown is saved for every booking (base fare, taxes, discounts, total).
- After booking, customers see a **confirmation page** that shows passenger details, and pricing breakdown.
- Admin can log in and access the **dashboard**, which shows:
  - Total bookings  
  - Total hotel bookings  
  - Total flight bookings  
  - Total revenue  
  - Latest 5 bookings with passenger and pricing details
