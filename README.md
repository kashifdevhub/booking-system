## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Booking System

**Booking System** is a Laravel-based web application for managing **hotel and flight reservations**.  
It provides a simple and structured workflow for handling customers, passengers, bookings, and pricing details.  
The system has two roles: **Customer** (to make bookings) and **Admin** (to view stats and manage dashboard).

---

## üìñ Project Overview
- Customers can create bookings for hotels or flights.
- Customers provide their details and can add multiple passengers/guests (name, email, phone).
- Each booking stores a related **Hotel/Flight ID**.
- Pricing breakdown is saved for every booking (base fare, taxes, discounts, total).
- After booking, customers see a **confirmation page** that shows customer details, passenger list, and pricing breakdown.
- Admin can log in and access the **dashboard**, which shows:
  - Total bookings  
  - Total hotel bookings  
  - Total flight bookings  
  - Total revenue  
  - Latest 5 bookings with passenger and pricing details  

---

## üöÄ Features
- Laravel 10+ project with clean architecture  
- Hotel and flight booking management  
- Customer and passenger details  
- Pricing breakdowns for each booking

- Admin dashboard with statistics and recent bookings  
- Database managed entirely with **migrations** (no SQL dumps)
